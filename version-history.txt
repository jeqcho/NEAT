V6
- Basic features complete
- Suggest to add synapse/node-editing mutations
- Alternative is to train using a single food and infinite eyesight

V7
- Disabled metabolism
- Disabled bounce
- Fixed bug to reset node states
- Change sense from [food_presence, dist_to_food, angle_to_food] to [food_presence, dis_x, dis_y]
- Made mutations independent
- Upgraded thinking mechanism
- Added documentation

V8
- Added synapse editing mutation
- Added synapse removing mutation
- Added proper node implantation
- Added node removing mutation
- Added mutation history

V9
- Made number of sensory and effector nodes a variable
- Commented out control nodes
- Added constants to node activation functions
- Commented out food regeneration
- Test every network on the same initial conditions (food position and blocky coordinates)

V10
- Build synapse mutation will not have looping chance to find suitable node pair, but instead have only one chance
- Removed unnecessary node-lists of network
- Removed constants in node activation functions
- Removed remove node mutation
- Changed remove synapse to disable synapse
- Added species and compatibility checks

V11
- Added mating
- Added speciation (protecting species)
- Code optimisation
- Population maintenance
- Introduced global innovation number

SUGGESTIONS:
- Add distance to wall sense
- Add memory nodes
- Add more penalty to blocked
-- eg: time/health penalty
- Spawn less food
- Add 8-directional sense
- Add proper population ranges (around 200)
- Add proper UI
- Show the best of each species
- Museum to store every known species to exist
